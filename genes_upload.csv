The small pink formal double flowers bloom over an extended period in early season (typically fall), providing weeks of color when most gardens are winding down. The moderate growth rate produces a bushy, compact habit, while the characteristically small leaves give the plant a neat, refined appearance suitable for formal garden settings. As a sasanqua, Cecilia offers several advantages over japonica types: earlier bloom time extending the camellia season, better sun tolerance, and generally improved cold hardiness. The formal double form—unusual among sasanquas which more commonly produce single or semi-double flowers—makes this cultivar distinctive. Important note from the International Camellia Register: Not to be confused with the 1954 C. japonica 'Cecelia' (different spelling). Well-suited for hedging, foundation plantings, espalier against walls, or container culture where its compact habit and long flowering period can be appreciated.
